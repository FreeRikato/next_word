    "## Project Description: Next Word Prediction Using LSTM \n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Overview:** This project aims to develop a deep learning model for predicting the next word in a given sequence of words. The model is built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which are well-suited for sequence prediction tasks. The project includes the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1- **Data Collection:** We use the text of Shakespeare's \"Hamlet\" as our dataset. This rich, complex text provides a good challenge for our model. \n",
    "\n",
    "2- **Data Preprocessing:** The text data is tokenized, converted into sequences, and padded to ensure uniform input lengths. The sequences are then split into training and testing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3- **Model Building:** An LSTM model is constructed with an embedding layer, two LSTM layers, and a dense output layer with a softmax activation function to predict the probability of the next word. \n",
    "\n",
    "4- **Model Training:** The model is trained using the prepared sequences, with early stopping implemented to prevent overfitting. Early stopping monitors the validation loss and stops training when the loss stops improving. \n",
    "\n",
    "5- **Model Evaluation:** The model is evaluated using a set of example sentences to test its ability to predict the next word accurately."
